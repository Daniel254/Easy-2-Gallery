Installation

1. Unpack archive in root folder of you modx installation
2. If this is your fresh installation: create a new folder 'gallery', the default path is assets/images/gallery.

   'dir' => 'assets/images/gallery/',
   
   If this is an upgrade, this module will use the existing config.easy2gallery.php values.

###########
$o = include_once(MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/modules/easy2/index.php');
return $o;
###########

  , click save.

4. Refresh modx manager, then open the module tab.
5. Install following instructions.
6. If install is successful, remove install folder, manually or by clicking delete button. module won't work if this folder exists.
